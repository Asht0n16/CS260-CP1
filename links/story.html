        <h2 id="ch1">Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time in the land of Jordan there was a young beautiful princess
          who was adored by all who met her. The fair maiden was named Alexandra.
          She lived comfortably in her castle which was situated on a rocky peninsula
          that jutted out into the ocean. Alexandra was destined to one day rule
          the great and prosperous land and she did all she could to prepare herself
          for that fateful day. But her father, the king, was a righteous man and
          a strong ruler. She knew that she had plenty of time before she would ever
          have to worry about anything as serious as that. So she spent her time
          enjoying time with her friends and family and learning about the world
          she lived in. However, fate had other plans. <br>
          One dark and stormy night, Alexandra lay awake in her bed. She was having
          trouble falling asleep with the loud thunder outside. She decided to get
          up and find a drink of water. She stones floors of the castle were cool
          to the touch as she made her way to the well. Alexandra jumped as a deafening
          crack of thunder boomed through the heavy rain. It sounded as if the thunder
          was trying to knock the castle right into the ocean! She heard some yelling
          and saw some lights coming from the barracks. <br>
          “It can never rain so much the guards don’t party all night…” Alexandra thought. <br>
          As she came to the well she reached in to grab the bucket. Suddenly someone
          grabbed her from behind. She spun around and came face to face with one
          of the royal guards. <br>
          “Princess!” gasped the royal guard. He was soaking wet and out of breath.
          “I need to get you out of here immediately! Hurry come with me!” He grabbed
          her hand and began pulling her towards the door. <br>
          “What’s happened!?” Alexandra asked as she stumbled to keep up with him. <br>
          “We’re under attack.” The guard replied. “A fleet of pirates sailed right
          up to the castle and caught us all by surprise. Your father is on his way
          to the royal navy and has sent me to get you out of danger.” <br>
          Alexandra couldn’t believe her ears. “Does father believe that the castle
          is in so much danger that we need to leave? Surely a couple pirates can’t
          be that much of a threat,” she protested to the guard. <br>
          They had come to a corner and they paused while the guard peered around
          it before taking off again down the hall towards the gates to the city. <br>
          “The pirates seem to be aided by mysterious technologies and magics,”
          the guard replied grimly. “it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” <br>
          They burst out a door that opened up to the courtyard. Alexandra froze
          when she saw what lay before her. Rain came pouring from the sky and
          she was drenched immediately. A bright fork of lightning illuminated the
          scene and she could see men fighting everywhere. She recognized the polished
          armor of the kingdom’s soldiers alongside other dark scary men. Everyone
          seemed to be yelling and fighting in chaos as buildings caught fire and
          other streams of multicolored lights ran through the sky. Another flash
          of lightning struck a soldier in the courtyard leaving him a blackened
          metal shell. <br>
          “Come!” The royal guard shouted.<br>
          They took off through the courtyard towards a massive hole in the wall
          where the gates had been. Alexandra crawled over remnants of the immense
          gates that seemed to have been thrown like they weighed nothing. She tried
          to ignore the scenes of carnage around her, but there were already dead
          bodies lying everywhere and blood mingled with rainwater on the stony ground. <br>
          The guard Alexandra was running with drew his sword as a pirate came running
          up. “Keep running!” the guard yelled to her. <br>
          Alexandra took off into the city. She looked back and saw the guard expertly
          deflect the pirate’s thrust and run his sword through the pirate’s stomach.
          He pulled out his sword and ran towards the princess. The city wasn’t doing
          any better than the castle. Everywhere Alexandra looked she saw people
          running and screaming in terror. The heavy rain didn’t seem to affect the
          fire that was spreading, and pirates were ransacking houses and cutting
          people down left and right. <br>
          “This way!” the guard shouted. <br>
          They ran down a smaller road that led to the city wall. Alexandra’s heart
          pounded almost as loudly as the thunder. They were nearly to the gate when
          two pirates came from a doorway and reached for Alexandra. The guard swung
          his blade at the pirates but they dodged. <br>
          “Go!” the guard yelled. “Don’t stop!” <br>
          Alexandra ran harder than she’d ever run before. She passed through the
          gates and headed towards the large trees off the side of the road. She
          looked back just as a pirate raised his curved sword above his head, a
          wicked smile showing his crooked teeth. The sword swung down and the royal
          guard fell limp to the ground. <br>
          Alexandra turned and ran into the trees. She blinked tears out of her eyes
          and felt them mingle with the rain. She tripped on a root and fell to the
          ground. She looked back once more and saw that the burning city was lighting
          up the sky. A dark silhouette of a ship was outlined by an eerie stream
          of light that shot from it into the sky. She scrambled to her feet and
          took off through the trees once more. Princess Alexandra was utterly alone.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ch2">Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>The princess ran and ran. She could barely see in the dense forest, but her fear and anger propelled her onward. She felt that if she stopped running that the reality of what just happened would settle in so she pushed on. Finally, overcome by grief and exhaustion, she collapsed beneath a large tree. Tears flowed from her eyes and her chest heaved trying to bring in air between her sobs. The darkness seemed to close in around her and exhaustion took over.
When she awoke, she was laying next to a warm fire in a small room. Startled, she sat up and looked around. A girl with long brown hair was sitting at a table across the room. She turned towards Alexandra and a nice smile came to her lips.
“You’re awake!” The girl said.
“Who are you?” Alexandra replied. “Where am I!?” She struggled to get to her feet.
“No no no.” The girl said as she moved towards Alexandra. “Just rest. You don’t want to get worked up again.” The girl gently pushed Alexandra back. “My name is Sadie. I found you passed out under a tree. You must have gotten lost in the storm. It’s okay now. You’re safe.”
“Thank you,” Alexandra replied gratefully.
Sadie sat down on the floor next to Alexandra. Alexandra looked around the room. It was small but cozy. The walls were wooden without any seems as if it were all carved out of a single piece of wood. The fireplace was lined with stones and dried mud. There was almost no furniture except a table and some chairs and a cozy looking bed in the corner.
“You're not from around here, are you?” Sadie asked.
“I don’t even know where here is.” Alexandra replied. “I feel like I was running all night. I… My…” Memories from the night before flooded into her mind. “My home was destroyed! I barely escaped…” Tears started to roll down her cheeks.
“Hey. Take it easy. You must've been wandering in the woods for quite a while, and you were in one of the worst storms I’ve ever seen!” Sadie said trying to reassure her.
“No, you don't understand!” Lex yelled. “I'm the princess! I need to go back! I need to know if my family…” She broke down crying once again.
“Don't worry. I'll help you. I'll be your new friend!” Sadie said. “What's your name, Princess?”
“Alexandra,” she replied.
“Well that’s a long name. Can I call you Lex for short?” Sadie asked.
“Sure. Whatever makes you happy.” Alexandra said.
“Well, Lex, it looks like we have quite the adventure ahead of us!” Sadie exclaimed. “But first you need to rest some more. Stay here and I’ll get everything ready.”
Sadie shot up and ran out the door. Lex tried relaxing but too many things were running through her head.
“I’m never going to be able to sleep like this,” she muttered. But she decided to try closing her eyes anyway. Sadie came back just a few minutes later to find Lex deep asleep.
“I’ve always wanted to leave the woods,” Sadie said to herself.
Lex awoke the next morning feeling much more refreshed. The fire was only warm coals now. She got up off the ground and moved to the table. There was a large bag on it full of food and other things. Sadie rolled over on her bed and looked at Lex. Her thick brown hair was messy and tangled.
“Good morning!” Sadie mumbled cheerfully. “Ready for an adventure?”
When they were all ready Sadie opened the door and bright sunlight blinded Lex. As her eyes adjusted Sadie began descending a ladder.
“Woah!” Lex exclaimed. “Your house is inside a tree!”
“Yep!” Sadie replied. “We all live in tree houses here!”
Lex looked around in wonder at the small village of tree houses. There were a few other people wandering around and birds were singing in the trees. “How did I not know about this place?” She asked.
“We live a simple and remote life. We hardly ever contact anyone outside the lost woods,” Sadie told her. “In fact, I’ve never even left the woods!”
“Ok. So which way leads back to my kingdom?” Lex asked.
“What!? You want to go back there now?” Sadie asked incredulously. “Do you plan on defeating those pirates singlehandedly? I’d prefer to have a longer adventure than that.”
“Then what do we do!?” Lex asked.
“We're gonna need some help.” Sadie replied. “I spoke with the village elder yesterday while you slept. He recited a legend about a powerful wizard who lives at the top of Calamity Peak beyond the woods to the West.”
“That’s a volcano, isn’t it?” Lex asked.
“Yep.” Sadie said.
“Why would he help us?” Lex asked.
“I don’t know.” Sadie replied. “He probably gets bored up there all alone and how could he say no to a princess like you?”
“This wizard doesn’t seem very promising,” Lex said.
“Yeah. But he's our only chance. He may be the only who knows how to defeat magic pirates.” Sadie explained.
“What's his name?” Lex inquired.
“He is called Galuron. They say he's from a land far to the east.” Sadie told her.
“Well then. There's no time to lose! Let's go talk to this Galuron. I need to help the people of my kingdom!” Lex exclaimed.
So, the pair marched determinedly into the Wandering Woods towards the distant smoky outline of Calamity Peak.

        <h2 id="ch3">Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>The two girls walked on the winding path through the woods. The sun sent glimmers of light through the green foliage that made everything look just a little magical.
“Why do they call this the Wandering Woods?” Lex asked.
“Because legend has it that anyone who steps off the path will be doing just that for the rest of eternity,” she answered.
“Sooo… we just stay on this path and we’ll be all good?” Lex nervously asked.
“I think so!” Sadie cheerfully replied. “I mean I've never tried leaving the woods, but I'm sure we could just ask for directions if we really needed to. I don't really believe in the curse of the Wandering Woods anyway.”
So, they continued their journey, Lex now a little more nervous than before. The beams of light seemed to be playing tricks on her eyes as she peered into the thicker trees just off the path. There always seemed to be something moving just out of sight.
The two young girls chatted as they walked. Sadie seemed to have a special talent of staying cheerful and keeping Lex’s spirits up. Lex was grateful for her. Soon, the world around them started to become darker as the sun sunk lower in the sky.
“We better stop for the night!” Sadie decided. “We don't want to run into any wolves!”
“Wolves!?” Lex said. “Can these woods get any worse?”
“Don't worry,” Sadie reassured. “There's worse things than wolves. Strange and dangerous beasts are said to roam in the west side of woods near the old ruins.”
“We've been traveling west all day,” Lex pointed out.
“Really?” Sadie asked, seemingly surprised. “You're right! We have been going west! I guess we would be really close to the ruins by now.”
“You mean like the old stone house I just saw right over there!?” Lex demanded.
“Yeah! Exactly like that!” Sadie said with a smile.
“So we're just sitting here in the open where you said strange dangerous beasts wander around!?” Lex asked incredulously.
“Hmm. I hadn't really thought of that.” Sadie replied.
“Well, how are we supposed to…” Lex stopped midsentence when she heard a low, quiet growling coming from the trees.
“What’s that!?” Lex asked.
“Probably just a wolf,” Sadie replied.
“Just a wolf!?” Lex shrieked.
“Shhh! You'll scare him!” Sadie whispered. “Unless of course it's not a wolf. Wolves always travel in packs, so as long as there's multiple growls, we can just climb a tree.”
“I only hear one growl.” Lex whispered.
“Then it might be one of the beasts who guard the ruins.” Sadie replied.
“What do we do then?” Lex asked with a tremble in her voice.
“The village elder said something about running downhill and being faster than at least one other person in your group…” Sadie responded quietly.
Slowly, the creature emerged from the trees and into the moonlight on the path. It was much larger than any wolf could be. It stood on two legs like a man but hunched forward so it's long arms dragged on the ground. Its head was long and hairy with pointy ears and two long tusks emerging from around the large snout. It eyed the two girls with its small, beady, black eyes while breathing heavily. Suddenly a deafening sound blasted from its mouth as it roared and began to run towards them.
“I think we should run.” Sadie peeped.
Terrified, the two girls dashed into the woods. “Let's head back to the ruin I saw earlier!” Lex yelled. “I think it might shelter us!”
“Good idea!” Sadie yelled. “Which direction was that in?”
The monster was gaining quickly so the two girls jumped quickly to the side behind a large tree. The beast was not quite as agile and ran into a tree, and while it stumbled, the girls hid behind a fallen log.
“Which way was the ruin you saw?” Sadie asked again, whispering now.
“Ummm.” Lex struggled to recall. “I can't remember. I got too turned around while we were running!”
The beast roared again in anger and began to sniff the ground with its large snout.
“I don't think climbing a tree would help,” Sadie said. “With those big arms, it could probably climb a lot better than we could.”
The sniffing got closer and closer. Suddenly the log the girls were hiding behind was lifted high into the air and the beast stood looking down at them. They took off, running blindly through the trees, the beast close behind.
“Look over there!” Lex yelled. “Another building!”
The girls turned and ran into a little clearing surrounding an old stone cottage.
“We can make it!” Lex yelled. “We’re almost there!”
Sadie didn't reply. Lex looked to her right where Sadie had been before and saw she wasn't there. She looked back and saw her on the ground as if she had tripped. The monster burst out from the trees and roared. Lex ran back and helped Sadie to her feet.
“Come on! We can make it.” She told her.
They reached the small crumbling wall surrounding the building when suddenly Lex felt a large hand surround her entire body. She screamed and squirmed, but the beast only squeezed tighter. She saw Sadie struggling in the monster's other hand. The beast roared triumphantly and marched back into the woods.
</p>
        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
        <h2 id="ch4">Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>The monster breathed deeply as it carried the two girls through the woods.
“Where is it taking us?” Lex whispered to Sadie.
“'It' is taking you home to my family for dinner,” the monster replied.
“You can talk!?” The two girls yelled simultaneously.
“Of course I can talk!” The beast replied indignantly. “Just because of the way I look, you assumed I was too stupid to talk? Racists.”
“Well... You were acting so savage before, we thought you were just a mindless beast.” Sadie explained.
“That was just to scare you. It's more fun when my prey are scared.” The monster chuckled. “Also, you should know that your silly excuses won't work on me. You taste good, just like any other human, and your bones only add texture.”
“What if I said we were on a journey to Calamity Peak to plead for the aid of a great magician in regaining my kingdom from a host of magic pirates?” Lex asked.
“Then I'd laugh in your face! And laugh even more as I roasted you over my fire,” the beast said.
“But it's true!” Lex replied. “I am Princess Alexandra, daughter of King John, and rightful ruler of this land.”
The beast laughed. “And I'm Bor, chief of the whole world!”
The beast chuckled as they entered another small clearing. There was a large house, old and crumbling like the others but with a warm light glowing from within. The monster ducked through the gaping door. He set the girls down and tied them up to a pole.
“I'm home!” He yelled. “And I brought dinner!”
The house rumbled as three monstrous children ran towards them. “Yay! We're so hungry!” they yelled.
“We need to get out of here!” Lex whispered as the monsters talked.
“I know. But how?” Sadie asked.
“I don't know.” Lex said as she peered around the room. She noticed Sadie’s pack on the ground nearby. “If I can reach your pack, I should be able grab your knife and cut us out.”
“With your feet? Our hands are tied.” Sadie pointed out.
“That may be a problem,” Lex admitted.
She strained against the ropes and stretched her feet toward the pack. After fumbling for a moment, she finally managed to push them even farther away.
“That worked well,” Sadie remarked.
“Quiet.” Lex retorted. “Do you have any better ideas?”
“Ok! The fire is ready! Time to start cooking.” The monster stomped over to them and picked them up by the stick they were tied to.
“No please!” Lex pleaded. “I promise I'll reward you once I get control of my kingdom again! Anything you want! There’s lot’s pirates I can send into the woods for you to eat.”
“Even if I believed you, I'd rather just eat you,” the beast replied. He reached over the fire to place the spit with Lex and Sadie on it onto two support beams.
“I'm too young to die!” Sadie sobbed.
“Stop whining already,” the monster demanded. And with that he plopped them over the hot flames.
Suddenly, a loud noise like a war horn blasted through the house. Out of nowhere, four people burst in brandishing weapons and yelling wildly. The beast was so surprised he tripped and fell on top of one of his cubs. Lex was beginning to sweat as the heat from the fire rose and tongues of fire licked her clothes.
The monster roared in anger but was immediately silenced when one of the warriors shouted.
“STOP! We aren’t here to hunt monsters today! We’d already have this place cleared out if we were. We just want the ladies.” He put his sword up to one of the young monster cubs. The large beast put his arms down and slumped to the ground. Two of the rescuers kept an eye on the family of beasts and the other two rushed to Lex and Sadie.
“Need some help?” one of them asked.
“Yes please.” They replied.
The two of them each grabbed an end of the spit. Together they lifted the two girls to safety and away from the fire.
“We're taking these girls!” said the one who seemed to be the leader. “Go find some deer to eat or something that's not two innocent girls wandering in the woods.”
And with that, the four warriors surrounded the girls and cautiously led them from the house, keeping an eye on the beasts the entire time. They walked slowly out the door and turned the corner.
“Run,” whispered the one in charge.
The six of them took off towards the trees. As they reached the woods Lex was panting.
“Why did we have to run?” she asked.
“That's why,” one of the rescuers pointed back towards the building. The beast came out carrying a large, nasty looking spiked club.
“With that thing,” the warrior said, “we’d be in for a fight. One hit with that thing would send any one of us to the great beyond. We’d totally be able to beat him, but not while protecting the two of you.”
“We better keep moving” said another one of the mysterious heroes. “He can probably smell us.”
So, they carried on, deeper and deeper into the woods, keeping at a brisk walk, until the sky started to lighten with dawn. Lex was so exhausted she could barely concentrate on stumbling forward. Finally, the leader called a halt and they all stopped with relief.
“We can rest here.” He said. “I think we're far enough out of its territory that it won't follow us.”
Lex was so tired she barely forced out a weary expression of gratitude before passing out once again.
</p>
        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
        <h2 id="ch5">Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>When Lex awoke, she sat up, stretched, and looked around at the trees surrounding her.
“Dang it,” She mumbled, “it wasn't a dream.”
“What'd you say?” Said a voice. Lex spun around. It was one of the knights who saved them the night before, but he had his helmet off. He was tall and thin with dark brown hair and looked surprisingly young, barely an adult.
“Where's everyone else?” Lex asked, looking around. Sadie was still asleep 10 feet away.
“They're out getting firewood and retrieving our horses,” the man answered. “We accidentally ran the wrong way when we rescued you last night! Hopefully that monster hasn't eaten them yet. They had all our supplies with them...”
There was a ruffle as Sadie sat up and stretched. “Good morning!” She yawned.
“Actually it's late afternoon. You girls slept almost all day!” The young man said. “Allow me to introduce myself, ladies. I am Sir Rufus Bartholomew Dalernicus III. Call me Dal for short. And don't ever call me Rufus. Unless you want your head chopped off.” He fingered a deadly looking battle axe. “Just kidding! I would never hurt two ladies like you. But seriously. Don't call me Rufus.”
“Sure thing Dal!” Sadie said. “Thanks so much for saving us last night! That's the closest I ever want to be to becoming food!” She looked around. “Where's everyone else?” She asked.
“Fetching our supplies,” Dal replied. “They should be back any... Oh! There they are right now.”
The three other knights returned leading five strong horses.
“Oh! Those horses are beautiful!” Sadie exclaimed. She rushed over to stroke one. “These are horses, right? I’ve never seen one in person before.”
“Yes! These are our trusty steeds!” said one the knights as he took off his helmet. He had long, bright blonde hair, a crooked smile, and a glint in his eye as if he thought everything were a joke. He also looked surprisingly young. In fact, as they all gathered around, Lex could see that all of the warriors were very young.
“Who are you guys?” Lex asked.
“I am Jack! The finest swordsman you'll ever meet! You've already met Dal,”
Dal waved.
“This is Sir. Kaleb, a White Archer from the north.”
“Sup.” Kaleb said.
“And this is Sir. Samwich the smart, from the land of many waters.”
Samwich rolled his eyes. “Call me Sam,” he said.
“And we,” Jack carried on, “are Le Group of Wand'ring Warriors, who roam these woods and other distant lands hunting for adventure! At your service.” The four of them bowed.
“Wow! Nice to meet you!” Sadie gushed.
“And who might you fine ladies be?” Jack asked.
“I'm Sadie! I'm from the village at the center of these woods.” Sadie said with a smile.
“I am Alexandra. You can call me Lex though.” Lex replied.
“Not THE Alexandra, Princess of the realm, the one the pirates have been hunting for... right?” Sam asked with a look of disbelief.
“Yep. That's me.” Lex said.
A look of awe was on each of the warriors faces as they stared at Lex. Suddenly Dal got down to one knee and bowed out of respect. The other knights followed suit.
“Please don't.” Lex said shyly. “I'm not the princess of anything right now.”
“That's what we're trying to fix!” Sadie said. “We're on our way to Calamity Peak to meet the wizard Galuron. He's the only one who would know how to defeat magic pirates!”
“Wow!” Jack marveled. He turned to Kaleb. “What's our schedule like?” He asked.
Kaleb pulled out a long scroll and scanned it carefully. “Completely empty,” he replied.
“Great! We can help these young ladies save the world then!” Jack stated with determination.
“Hooray!” Sadie shouted.
The next morning they awoke early, when the dew was still fresh on the green plants around them. The sun was low in the east and they could see Calamity Peak smoking to the west.
As they were packing their gear onto the horses Kaleb patted one of them and turned to the girls. “This was our packhorse, but we can saddle her and redistribute the weight and you two should be able to ride together on her.”
“Thanks,” Lex said. Sadie was too excited to say anything.
“Alright gang!” Jack shouted. “Let's get this show on the road.” And he started off towards the west.
“If only there were a road to get the show on.” Sam grumbled as he tripped on a root on the way to his horse.
“Even if we don't find a road soon,” Dal responded, “we only need to head towards the volcano. Eventually we’ll reach the village of Elk Ridge at the base of the mountain. The only path up to the peak starts there.”
Travel was slow, as the trees were dense and the ground uneven. But each time they crested a hill, or entered a clearing, they could see they were still headed in the right direction.
“This is so exciting! I've never actually seen a horse before,” Sadie whispered to Lex. “They don't live in the woods, and we have very few travelers visit our village and they're always on foot.”
“That's kind of sad,” Lex said. “I've grown up around horses, being the princess and all. I've known how to ride since I was 6.”
“It's kinda uncomfortable. The saddle I mean,” Sadie grunted as she shifted around. “My butt hurts.”
“You'll get used to it.” Lex reassured her.
Finally, they reached the edge of the trees and an open field lay before them. Far away, they could see a small farmhouse and they headed toward it. Lex was amazed at the beautiful wildflowers growing in the field. The flowers were every color you could imagine; red, blue, yellow, white, even some shades Lex never knew existed. Sadie seemed equally fascinated by the flowers.
As they neared the farmhouse, a short sturdy woman came out to greet them. Children were playing in and around the house. “What are you travelers doing so far away from the road?” The woman said to them.
“I'm afraid as we traveled at night in the woods, we lost the trail.” Jack replied.
“I’m surprised you’re still not in there wandering!” The woman said. “Just follow this little path and it'll take you back to the big road. Left'll take you back to the woods and--Terence! Put down that hoe and stop chasing your brother.” The woman sighed. “Sorry. And going right'll take you towards Elk Ridge. You’d better be careful going to either place. I hear of troubles in the village and supposedly there are monsters in the woods.”
“Monsters! In the woods! How terrifying!” Dal exclaimed.
“Are all these kids yours?” Jack asked.
“Yep! I got seven of these ragamuffins.” She said proudly.
“Seven?” Jack said “Seveeeen!”
“Seven!” Dal, Kaleb, and Sam said in unison.
Sam chuckled and turned towards Lex. “It's an inside joke,” He explained. “I don't understand it completely. I don’t think any of us do.”
After thanking the woman, the group headed up the path towards the road like the woman suggested. Soon they reached the road and headed west once again. They moved much faster, now that they didn't have to weave between trees or walk slowly over roots. Shortly before nightfall they approached the village.
“Finally,” Lex sighed “we can rest. And sleep on real beds.”
“I don't know about that. It'll be hard to get rest with that parade,” said Sam, pointing toward the village.
There was a large group of people shouting and carrying pitchforks and torches marching in the street. As the group approached, they were able to see more clearly that the shouting was more angry than happy. Lex gasped as she saw a young girl dressed in white tied to a pole being carried by the crowd. The villagers took her to a pedestal in the center of town and set her down. A man also climbed the pedestal and shouted to the crowd, gesturing to the girl.
“It is time!” he yelled. “Our troubles will end! For the great Ember Dragon will now come to accept her sacrifice!” The crowd cheered as the girl screamed.

        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
        <h2 id="ch6">Chapter 6</h2>
        <p>“We have to help her!” yelled Lex.
“Already on it,” said Jack. He drew his sword and led the others towards the pedestal. As the four warriors pushed through the crowd and climbed up to the girl in the white dress and the man.
“What are you doing!? Are you trying to destroy our town?” he shrieked.
“We're not destroying any town. Just saving an innocent life.” Jack explained as he pushed the man backwards off the pedestal.
Sam used a knife to cut the ropes binding the girl to the pole. When she was freed she crumpled into his arms and wept.
“It’s okay!” Sam said. “You’re safe now.”
“I’m not safe!” she sobbed. “None of us are! Look!”
The group turned to follow her pointing finger and looked up towards the mountain. Something was flying towards them. Something big. A woman in the crowd screamed and the rest of the mob dispersed quickly. Lex and Sadie ran towards the pedestal where the others were.
“What is it!?” Sadie yelled to them.
None of them replied. But they didn't need to. Everyone knew what it was. It was a dragon. A loud roar rumbled through the sky. It had a long, snake-like body with shiny red scales. Its mouth was large enough to swallow a horse and it was full of long pointy teeth. No wings came from its body, yet it was somehow able to snake through the air like an eel in water.
“You guys can kill it, right?” Sadie said.
“I don't know.” Jake said. “Never killed one before.”
“Hey! It looks a lot like that basilisk we fought in the desert!” Kaleb said. “We should be able to kill it the same way.”
“Except it's a lot bigger and can fly and can probably breath fire.” Sam muttered. “But yeah, same principal. Avoid the head.”
Jack looked at Lex and Sadie. “You ladies better take shelter.” He told them. “If we get burned to a crisp, at least you might be able to still finish your quest.”
Lex and Sadie ran to a nearby building and watched through the door. The battle was fierce, with much yelling, fire, sword swinging, arrow shooting, and claw slashing. The four warriors were obviously very skilled. They dodged every whip of the dragon's tail and jet of flame. Kaleb targeted what seemed to be the soft chinks in the dragon's armor from afar while the others struck where they could. After a while, the ground was soaked with the dark blood from the dragon which bubbled and hissed evilly. The dragon collapsed on the ground and Dal smashed its head with his war hammer. It twitched a couple more times and then stood still.
“That was fun!” Jack beamed.
“What a stupid dragon,” Sam said as he kicked the fresh corpse. “If it had just stayed in the air and rained fire on us, we would've been toast! Literally!”
“It's a good thing it didn't do that then!” Sadie yelled as she ran out towards them. “I would've been very sad if you were burned to a crisp.” She hugged Sam tightly.
“Yes. You guys were very impressive!” Lex said. “Much more talented than many of the best knights at my castle. If only you had been there. Perhaps you could've saved my kingdom.”
“I doubt it, princess,” Jack said. “Dragons are one thing. Pirates are dirty. They always cheat. Especially if their magic pirates.”
“They're the worst kind.” Dal lamented.
“Well, I don't think the townspeople will mind if we stay in this house, will they?” Jack pointed to one of the buildings that was relatively unburned. Kaleb tracked down their horses and they set up camp in the house. There they rested in preparation for the long hike up the mountain the next day.
The next morning the company ate breakfast and packed up quickly. As they rode their horses out of the town, a few people were gathered around the enormous carcass.
“Sorry for the mess!” Jack called out.
The trail up the mountain was long and windy. The lower slopes of the volcano were forested and had abundant wildlife. The shade from the trees kept the company out of the sun and the pleasant smell of pines brought a smile to Lex’s lips. However near midday the group rose above the tree line to a steep and desolate slope. The sun became blinding but the rise in elevation brought a drop in temperature. Biting wind swept the group as their horses plodded up the slope.
Sadie rode in back next Sam and the two were in deep conversation. Kaleb and Dal were discussing their favorite music. Lex rode up to the front of the group where Jack was leading. He turned to her as she came up beside him.
“How goes life?” he asked her.
“Just fine and dandy,” Lex replied. “I'm climbing a volcano to speak to a wizard who may or may not know a way for me to take my kingdom back from some evil magic pirates.”
“What was it like growing up in the castle?” Jack asked.
Lex began telling him of her life as a princess and the things she loved to do with her family and friends. Happy memories came to her mind and Jack seemed to really enjoy her stories. The trail turned into a tiny ridge on the side of a large cliff. On the left the cliff rose above them high into the air and to the right the cliff fell for hundreds of feet. Lex was grateful for the conversation because it helped distract her from the terrifying drop just a few feet away.
Eventually they reached the rim of the crater. Inside they could see the heat rising in waves from the molten rock far below. The trail wound a short way down before disappearing into a cave. They dismounted their horses and led them down the steep trail. Lex was surprised to find that the nipping cold turned to fierce heat as hot gas came from the rocks around them. She had never been any where so hot! She felt like she was about the melt into a puddle of princess goo!
Finally, they reached the small cave opening. As soon as they entered the temperature dropped drastically and became very pleasant. There were small gems in the wall that emitted a soft greenish light. The cave was a large room with a small pond of clear water and a tunnel that continued deeper into the mountain. The group tied their horses to a stalagmite, took a drink from the clear water, and continued deeper into the cave.
“How fancy.” Dal remarked.
“Why does this wizard live all alone in a volcano that's so hard to get to?” Lex wondered aloud.
“So I'm not constantly bothered by silly mortals,” said an unfamiliar voice.
Startled, the men drew their weapons and looked around at the cave walls surrounding them.
“What are you guys doing?” the voice asked. “Just keep walking so I can talk to you face to face.”
The group continued further into a large brightly lit cavern. There were fascinating objects all over the place. Little glass bulbs hang from the ceiling and emitted bright light. There were large comfortable couches and rugs on the ground. Against the wall on a cabinet stood a big object that looked like a picture frame except the pictures inside of it were moving and making lots of noise. A big white box with doors stood in the corner next to other strange boxy gadgets.
Sitting on a couch in the middle of the room sat a young man with a dark complexion holding a black rectangular stick staring at the moving picture. A large fluffy cat was snuggled up to him.
“So, you must be the great wizard Galuron.” Lex said to him.
“Bruh,” he responded with a tinge of annoyance. “Can't you see I'm watching the game?”
</p>
        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
        <h2 id="ch7">Chapter 7</h2>
        <p>The group stepped forward cautiously, gaping at the strange and wonderful things filling the cave. A noise like a crowd of a thousand people came from the large moving picture as small people ran across a wooden rectangle.
Lex stepped forward towards the wizard. “We're here to seek your guidance and wisdom. You see, I am —”
“Princess Alexandra, I know.” Galuron interrupted. “I know everything, young grasshopper.”
“Perfect!” Lex said. “How do I save my kingdom from a bunch of magic pirates?”
“Have you tried turning it off and on again?” the wizard replied.
Lex stared back at him in confusion.
“No one ever laughs at my jokes…” Galuron sighed.
“How can you joke about something so serious!?” Lex demanded.
Galuron took a deep breath and pointed the black stick at the moving picture. The noise quickly became much quieter until it was nearly silent. He lifted to cat off his lap and stood up. Little crumbs fell off of his clothes as he stretched.
“If the ancient prophecies are true,” he said, “the pirates must have uncovered the fabled treasure of Doh. This treasure, whatever it is, grants the owner almost unlimited power. The pirate lord Squishy must have used its power to invade your castle so easily. There may only be one weapon powerful enough to counter the magic Squishy draws from the treasure of Doh. You’ll need to travel to Dawn Lake. In the center of the lake is an island which is home to an old ruined city with a small creek running through it. In this city creek you should find the weapon you seek.”
“Thank you for this guidance, master.” Lex said.
“Sure. It’s whatever.” Galuron shrugged. “You guys might as well stay here for the night. Tomorrow will be the beginning of a very long journey. Just try not to break anything here. And don't be loud. I'm watching the game. The Warriors are totally killing the Lakers!”
The next day Lex, Sadie, and the boys finished packing quickly and started to take off. No one had been able to find Galuron that morning, but they didn't want to delay any longer.
“It's a shame we didn't get to thank Galuron properly,” Sadie remarked as they led their horses out into the crater of Mt. Doom. “He was really funny!”
“Hey! Where do you think you guys are going!” A voice called from behind them.
Galuron emerged from the cave leading his own horse loaded with supplies.
“I'm coming with you!” he said proudly.
“What? Why?” Jack asked.
“I get a little bored all by myself up here. Every few decades I like to get some fresh air. And you guys are the lucky winners this century to be my travel companions.”
“That's the only reason?” Sam asked suspiciously.
“Well... This quest is also super important to ensure that the world isn't destroyed. So, I’ll be tagging along to make sure everything runs smoothly,” he admitted.
So, the group with their newest member descended the mountain. It was very sunny and warm as there was no wind to cool the air down. Lex was very relieved when they finally reached the trees again.
They reached Elk Ridge in the early afternoon. The ember dragon’s carcass was still in the center of town and starting to smell a little bit. The townspeople were glaring at them as they rode down the street.
“We might as well stay here for the night,” Kaleb said. “I'd rather sleep in a bed than on the ground.”
They found an inn and picketed their horses outside and walked in. Lex noticed that people were still glaring at them. When the man behind the counter saw them, he stiffened. It was the same man who led the mob in the attempted sacrifice of the young girl.
“What do you think you're doing here?” he grumbled. “We want nothing to do with you after what you did to our town.”
“You mean after we saved your town?” Dal asked.
“Saved!? You burned down three homes and left a giant stinking corpse in the center of town! How are we going to get that out?” the man demanded.
“That's one way to look at it...” Sam mumbled.
“Look. We'll pay you for food, a room tonight, and supplies for our trip and we'll be out of your hair be sunrise tomorrow,” Jack said. “How can anyone say no to money?”
The innkeeper grumbled as he took the money and brought out some food. As the group ate, Lex overheard some people at another table.
“I saw some interesting folk yesterday,” said one. “Very strange clothes. Lots of piercings. One had an eye patch and a peg leg.”
“I saw them too!” Said the other person. “They even talked to me. They asked if I had seen a princess wandering around recently.”
“What did you say?” The first person asked.
“I laughed in his face is what I did!” The other said. “Why would any princess be all the way out here?”
“We need to go!” Lex whispered to everyone else. “Those people saw pirates here in town. They suspect I’m here!”
“Let's wait until night time.” Jack suggested. “If we leave now, we'll draw attention to ourselves. If we sneak out at night, we'll be long gone without any pirates knowing!”
That night they snuck out of town as quietly as they could. Once far enough down the road, they broke into a gallop. When they finally stopped for a rest, Lex was shivering from the cold night.
“Let's get a few hours of sleep,” Jack said to the group. He turned to look at Lex “That hotel wasn't cheap you know,” he grumbled.
“I'm sorry,” she replied.
“I'm just teasing you,” Jack laughed. “I'll do anything to keep you safe, princess.”
As she fell asleep Lex thought about how grateful she was for Jack and his companions.
The next day they trekked onward towards Dawn Lake. The weather was pleasant for the first few days. The boys were playful and boisterous. Sadie played along happily. Galuron was always cracking jokes when he wasn’t staring at his small glowing object of curious workmanship that “revealed enlighteningly dank memes.” At first Lex stayed apart, but soon the happiness and joking pierced through her grief and she joined in. It was the first time she had felt happy in quite a while and she got close to everyone in the group, especially Jack.
After a couple days of traveling across hills and through forests, the trail went through a gully with steep walls on either side. Suddenly, a little way up the gully, four scruffy looking men came out from a boulder holding wicked looking swords. Behind the group, four more thieves appeared, blocking all exits. Jack and his companions drew their weapons. Galuron looked up from his small glowing rectangle.
“Arrr! We only be here for the princess!” one of the ambushers yelled. “Move aside ye scurvy dogs and let us take her back to the castle where she belongs.”
“Yeah right,” Jack said. “Over our dead bodies!”
“T’would be our pleasure,” the pirate growled, and he and the other pirates closed in.
Galuron went back to his device as the four other men engaged the pirates. The pirates were obviously no match for the Four Wand'ring Warriors, who easily dispatched each of the attackers. They took care not to kill the pirates unnecessarily, only knocking them unconscious or leaving them with wounds that would prevent them from following them. When the last pirate fell to the ground the group rode away quickly.
“I didn't think there would be any thieves on this road!” Sadie remarked.
“Those weren't just normal highway thieves,” Dal said. “Only pirates talk like that! It’s a good thing that pirates are just a bunch of wimps on dry land.”
“We're going to have watch our backs from now on,” Sam said. “Maybe even have a watch each night.”
“You're right,” Jack said. “Pirates don’t usually come so far off their boats. We need to be careful and always be ready.”
That night, Jack took the first watch. Lex lay awake not being able to sleep, watching Jack through the fire. Soon she decided to get up and sit with him.
“You need sleep, your highness,” Jack told her as she sat down.
“I'm not tired,” Lex said. “Plus, you could use some company.”
They sat in silence for a little. “I'm very grateful for your help, Jack. I never would have ever gotten anywhere without you,” Lex whispered. “But why are you doing it? I'm sure you have better things to do than risking your lives to help me.”
“How could I resist helping a beautiful princess?” Jack said. “If this doesn't get me fairytale hero status, I don't know what will. Plus, there's the added bonus of being with you.”
Lex was glad it was dark, to hide her blushing. “Thanks. It's been really great to get to know all of you too.” She paused. “You especially, though.”
Lex looked up at Jack. He was staring at her with his playful blue eyes. He leaned in towards her and she felt herself leaning towards him. Their lips touched and rush of emotion swelled through Lex. They sat close together hand in hand for a little.
Finally, Lex stood up, said good night, and returned to her blankets. As she lay staring at the stars, Lex tried to calm the emotions swirling inside of her. It was her first kiss! Eventually exhaustion overwhelmed her, and she fell into a fitful sleep.
</p>
        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
        <h2 id="ch8">Chapter 8</h2>
        <p>The next day was beautiful. Lex was very happy as she packed up her things and ate breakfast. She glanced constantly over at Jack who also seemed very happy.
As they ate, Kaleb was studying a map. “It's only about a day's ride to the lake shore,” he said. “And then just a couple miles along the edge to a village. We can get a boat there to take us to the center of the lake.”
When they finished eating, Jack helped Lex into her saddle. Then he winked up at her and walked to his own horse.
“Hey guys, I'm going to ride ahead to scout for danger,” he told everyone. “We don't want to fall into another ambush like yesterday.” He pushed his horse into a gallop and quickly rode up the trail.
Kaleb, Dal, Sam, and Galuron were talking and joking in front, but Lex stayed back, deep in thought as she rode. Suddenly Sadie was next to her.
“So. How was it last night?” she asked Lex with a smile.
“What? How did you know?” Lex blushed.
“I've been waiting for it to happen for a while now.” Sadie laughed. “You guys are so obvious.”
“Well, so are you and Sam!” Lex retorted.
“Nah, I don't think he even really notices me.” Sadie said. “But I'll keep working on him.”
Lex and Sadie chatted as they rode throughout the day. Finally, near dusk, they created a hill and Lex gasped. An enormous body of sparkling water lay ahead of them. Below them, Jack was riding up the hill towards them.
“It's just a little farther to the town!” Jack told them when he reached them. “We can make it before it gets too dark if we hurry.”
Lex rode up to the front of the group next to Jack and spoke with him the rest of the way. They reached a small town on the shore a little after sunset and found an inn. They ate dinner quickly and went upstairs to their rooms.
As Lex walked towards her shared room with Sadie, Jack grabbed her hand.
“Good night.” he said as he kissed her hand.
“Good night,” Lex replied. Jack started to walk away, but Lex ran to him and gave him a little kiss. Then she ran to her room and closed the door.
The next morning the group went down to the docks to find a boat to hire. The only fisherman willing to take them all the way out to the island was a hairy, old, grumpy man whose skin was dark and leathery from being out in the sun his whole life.
“Sure, I'll take yeh to that there island.” He said to them. “But thar ain't no way I'll set foot off mah boat. There's a powerful curse there! The ghosts of the ancients who lived thar still haunt them shores!”
The man's boat was a dingy sailboat with so many leaks that Lex was convinced they would’ve been better off just swimming their way to the island. They spent a couple hours bailing water over the side before they reached land again. The rocky shore rose up a bit before reaching a thick wall of trees. Lex couldn’t see anything through the thick foliage.
“Are you sure this is the right island?” she asked the old fisherman.
“This here is the only island on Dawn Lake. I would know. I've fished these waters since I was a wee lad.” The old man responded.
As the group jumped ashore, Jack asked the old man where they should meet him when they were finished. The old man started laughing so hard Lex thought he was going to choke and die.
“I only agreed to take yeh to the island! Thar ain't no way yer gettin off this here island alive, even if I decided to wait for yeh!” The old man cackled as he rowed his boat back out into the water.
“That sure inspires confidence,” Sam remarked sarcastically.
“There aren’t really ghosts here, are there?” Jack asked Galuron.
“I don't believe in ghosts,” he replied. “It would be fascinating through… Let’s explore the island!” He didn't look worried at all.
The island seemed to be a big hill with the ground sloping away from the water, so the group decided to hike to the top of the island and start their search there. The plants were so thick they were forced to use their swords to clear a path. As they approached the top of the hill, Lex began to see stone pillars and other structures that had succumbed to the elements long ago. She walked towards one of the pillars to study it closer. She could barely make out beautiful carvings of people and an intricate design that looked like a long snake with many heads. Soon the party reached a break in the trees and an immense pyramid rose from the ground. A flight of steep crumbling stairs led to an enclosed structure at the top. Tree roots and ivy snaked up the sides of the pyramid as if the jungle were trying to pull the pyramid into the soil.
Galuron eagerly led the way up the stairs.
“Haven’t seen any ghosts yet!” he said to the group.
Lex gasped for air as they reached the top of the stairs. It was pitch black through the opening in front of them. Sam grabbed a torch from his pack and lit it with a few sparks from his flint and steel. Galuron touched a few spots on his device and suddenly a bright white light came out of the back.
“Why didn’t you do that before I lit the torch?” Sam asked.
“Because I don’t want to drain all of the battery.” Galuron replied matter-of-factly.
The group entered the room and Galuron shone his light around. Lex couldn’t see much through the gloom but it looked like much of the same type of carvings that were on the pillars outside lined the walls. Lex stepped on something that snapped loudly and echoed through the room. She looked down and saw to her horror that she had stepped on a bone. Right next to her foot she saw a human skull grinning up at her. She let out a terrified shriek and jumped.
“Shhhh!” Jack said to her as he grabbed her tightly. “It’s ok! He can’t hurt you.”
Suddenly they heard a noise come from the center of the room and the group stood in startled silence. It sounded like hundreds of pounds of metal scraping on rock. It stopped, and the group listened to what sounded like heavy breathing from deeper in the room. Galuron turned his light slowly towards the sound. In the light Lex could see what looked like scales, and a lot of them. She could see many large coils heaped on top of each other moving up and down to the sound of breathing.
“This isn’t doing anything.” Galuron grumbled as he turned off his light.
For a few moments they only had the light from and Sam’s torch and they could see light from the flame reflecting off the monster’s scales. Galuron spoke a few unintelligible words and bright ball of light appeared in his hand. He threw it high in the air and it stayed suspended near the ceiling as it illuminated the whole room. The large creature was breathtakingly beautiful. It reminded Lex of her father’s favorite pet, a snake from a land far to the south. However, this creature was much larger and much more colorful. Its scales shimmered, and Lex could see almost every color of the rainbow coming from the coiled mass. It’s head emerged from the coils and was resting on the ground. It was triangular with large horns and spikes along the ridges. There was a beautiful plume of feathers that lined it’s neck and it looked absolutely majestic as it lay sleeping.
“I vote that we let it sleep and look for whatever it is we're looking for somewhere else,” Sam whispered.
“No look!” Dal pointed towards the ground under the massive coils. There was a trap door mostly covered by the beast.
“Great. What are the odds that what we're here to get is under there?” Sam grumbled.
“I could kill it while it's sleeping.” Dal suggested. “Its head is just right there. I should be able to chop it off without it ever waking up.”
Dal tiptoed towards the beast and drew his large axe. He stopped at the head and raised the blade above his head.
“Wait!” Galuron whispered. “I just remembered what kind of monster it is guarding the treasure!”
But it was too late. The sword was already in motion. It chopped clean through the neck and the head fell motionless to the ground. The neck started thrashing back and forth violently. It knocked Dal back towards the rest of the group and he fell in his back. The entire pile of coils started to writhe.
“Look! It has another head!” Sadie yelled.
Another head had risen from the back and turned towards the group. It opened its maw and roared. Then it was joined by another head, and another. Soon more heads than they could count rose up into the air, hissing and roaring. The thrashing neck stub started to smoke and bubble. Suddenly it split down the middle. The two stub necks started to bulge at the ends, becoming bigger and longer. Eyes and horns poked out of the scales and huge gaping jaws formed, quickly to be filled by rows of pointy teeth. In a matter of seconds, where there was once one head, there were now two.
“It's called a hydra,” Galuron stated. “When you cut off a head, two grow in its place.”
“We can see that.” Jack said as he drew his sword. The others also drew their weapons and Kaleb helped Dal back onto his feet.
“You and Sadie go back by the entrance far away from us,” Jack said to Lex. “We'll take care of this.”
“Be safe, please!” Lex said to him and kissed him before running with Sadie towards one of the large pillars.
“Wait what!?” Sam said, nearly dropping his sword. “When did...? How...? Why did...? I thought...”
“Pay attention!” Jack yelled to him. “Run around to its back and think of a way to kill it.”
“Which way is its back!?” Sam yelled.
He ran to the other side anyway so that they surrounded the beast. It had enough heads that each warrior had at least two heads to fend off. Galuron stood back reading from a large book that came out of nowhere.
Lex watched the fight with terror from the entrance and it didn't seem to be going well. There were too many heads attacking each person and they seemed to be barely dodging each attack. She saw Kaleb shoot an arrow right into an eye. This angered the beast and he was savagely attacked by three heads at once and barely jumped out of the way in time. Lex wished desperately that there was a way she could help.
Suddenly Dal yelled out in pain. A head had bit him in the leg and pulled him into the air. Without thinking. Lex ran towards the monster yelling and trying to get its attention. She picked up a rock and threw it at the head. Miraculously, the rock hit it right in the eye and it dropped Dal. Lex ran and dragged him back away from the reach of the hydra. His leg was bleeding badly. Sadie ran to Lex and Dal tried to stop the bleeding with some fabric torn from her clothes.
Lex looked up towards the others. With one less person to split the attention of the hydra, they each had more heads to deal with. Sam was holding his left arm strangely as if it had been broken and Kaleb was out of arrows and focused only on dodging attacks.
Suddenly, with a powerful voice, Galuron yelled. Lex didn't know what he said, but all of the sudden, the entire area was still. Each writhing head of the hydra was frozen in the air. Lex tried to ask Galuron what he did, but she couldn't move her mouth to form any words.
Galuron pulled a glittering sword out from under his robes and walked towards the hydra. He climbed over the coils to the very center. He looked around for a little then thrust the sword into the scaly hide with another mysterious word. A loud screech came from each of the unmoving heads and the hydra. Cracks started to appear in the hydra and it fell apart piece by piece. When each hydra piece hit the floor it burst into dust. Soon nothing was left of the hydra except for a pile of ash.
Galuron spoke another strange word and Lex and the others were unfrozen. Galuron slumped to the ground, apparently exhausted by the powerful magic he had used.
Jack, Kaleb, and Sam came to where Lex and Sadie were helping Dal.
“Kaleb and Sadie, you stay here and tend to the wounded. Lex and I still have to find whatever magical artifact it is we're here to get,” Jack instructed. “Make sure Galuron is okay and Dal doesn't bleed out. Also check on Sam's arm.”
“This thing better be worth all this.” Lex said angrily.
“Come princess. There may be even more dangers below.” Jack lifted the trapdoor and Lex stepped into the darkness within.

        <p>Lex’s heart beat quickly as she and Jack walked down the long spiraling staircase. Light flickered on the stone walls from the torch Jack was holding. The stairs seemed to go on forever. Finally, the staircase opened into a small room. Spooky shadows danced on the walls from strange artifacts of curious workmanship that lay all over the floor. In the center of the room was a pedestal with a large dusty book.
“There’s so much stuff in here!” Lex said as she stepped over a shiny bronze breastplate studded with precious gems. “How are we supposed to know what to take?”
“I don’t know,” Jack replied as he fingered a glittering sword stuck in the ground.
Lex made her way to the pedestal with the book and peered at the cover. She blew the dust off and coughed a bit as it billowed into the air. The book was old, but she could clearly make out the words embossed into the leather.
“Library of Heroes,” Lex read aloud.
Jack looked up from the massive shield he was looking at and began walking towards her.
“You have done well to make it to this room, hero.” Lex began to read from the first page inside. “Throughout the ages, many like you shall enter this room seeking aid in their question. There is an item here for each of you, a special artifact carefully crafted to your unique situations. Herein you shall find your names listed by importance of your quest and the tool that has been provided for you. Be warned. Should you take from this room any object that is not meant for you, the very fabric of reality may be rent and time and space will stop in their regular continuum. The curse you bring upon the universe could mean the end of all life and existence.”
“Wow,” Jack said. “That’s a lot of big words.”
“Hey! My quest is pretty important, so I must be at the front of this thing,” Lex said as she turned the page. She scanned the different names on the left side of the parchment.
“Bulbo Buggins,” Jack read over her shoulder. “Ring of Power. Lonk, Quadforce of Bravery. Colonel Sanders, Spork. There’s some funny names in here!”
“Look! I found Galuron’s name!” Lex pointed.
“What’s an iPawd Touch?” Jack asked.
“No idea.” Lex replied. “It must have been an amazing quest he was on because he’s just a couple lines away from me!”
“Alexandra, Princess of Jordan… Meat Stick?” Jack read.
“Meat Stick!?” Lex said. “What’s that supposed to be?”
“I don’t know, but let’s get looking.” Jack replied.
The pair began scanning the room. Lex sifted through many strange and amazing things. There was a gold helmet with pointy rods sticking out of it that looked like the sun. She picked up a an ornate spoon studded with glowing green gems. Jack was fascinated with a smaller black object. It was shaped like a letter “L” with a hole in one end and a slender trigger inside the bend. Lex almost fell when she stepped on a black wooden board that had wheels on the bottom of it.
“This is useless!” Lex huffed in frustration. “I don’t see anything that sounds like a meat stick!”
“Hmmm…” Jack said as he looked around the room. “The book doesn’t say anything else for you?”
“No!” Lex grumbled as she stormed to the book. “It’s totally useless!”
Then Lex noticed something on the ground next to the pedestal with the book. She bent over and picked up a white paper bag with two yellow arches on the side of it. She set it on top of the book and pulled out a folded paper. The front read “Meat Stick. Setup and care instructions.” Lex turned it around and found a hastily scribbled note on the back.
“My apologies to whoever this item was meant for. I was really hungry.” Lex read. “Oh no!” Lex looked into the bag again. “All I see is crumpled tissue and crumbs!” She said despairingly.
Jack came over and peered into the bag as well. “What about this thing?” he asked. He pulled out a skinny clear tube. “This looks like a stick.”
Suddenly a loud boom echoed from the stairway, followed by sounds of distant shouting. Another boom shook dust from the ceiling.
“We better go!” Jack said as he grabbed Lex’s arm.
“Do you have the stick?” Lex asked as she stumbled towards the stairs.
“Yeah! It's in my pocket.” Jack said, reaching the first step. “After you.” He gestured to Lex.
Lex began running up the stairs. Things were disturbingly quiet after the second boom.
“I hope everyone’s alright up there!” Lex panted.
“Yeah,” Jack replied. He sounded a little distracted by something.
Finally, Lex burst out of the trapdoor and stopped dead in her tracks. A large group of scruffy looking men filled the room around her with curved swords in their hands. Sadie had a gag in her mouth and was being held by an especially large brute with a eyepatch. Galuron was slumped over still weak from his spell and he too was shackled.
     A woman stepped towards Lex. “Hello, princess,” she said. “Why don't you hand over that book and you won't get hurt.”
     Behind her Jack drew his sword. “I'll never give you this book!” Lex yelled.
     ”Hahahaha!” The woman laughed. “Silly princess. You obviously don't understand the situation.”
     ”Lex,” Jack said seriously. “Give her the book.”
     Lex turned around. Jack's sword wasn't held defensively against the pirates. He was pointing it directly at her!

        <h2 id="ch10">Chapter 10</h2>
        <p>”I don't want to hurt you, Lex,” Jack said menacingly. “Just give her the book.”
     Lex couldn't believe what she was hearing. “I-I don't understand!” She stammered.
      ”It's not that complicated, princess,” the woman chuckled. “You see, we pirates hired Jack and his crew to gain your trust and make sure you weren't doing anything that would threaten his power.”
     ”After I discovered your plans, I met with Amara here to set up this little trap to get you, and whatever was hidden on this island.” Jack explained. “I'm truly sorry to have to do this. I did grow quite fond of you. But I know better than to let emotions get in the way of business.”
     Lex felt crushed inside. She did know what to say. “But-but I trusted you!” Lex stammered. “I cared for you. And I thought you cared for me!”
     ”You were wrong!” The woman said.
     Lex let the book fall to the ground and stood silently as the Pirates grabbed her by the arm. Jack picked up the book and followed the woman with the dark red hair.
     Kaleb, Dal, and Sam walked with the pirates while Sadie, Galuron, and Lex were roughly guided to a waiting ship in the water.
     ”So you just betrayed us too, huh?!” Sadie asked Sam. Sam said nothing and turned away sadly. Sadie started to sob, but Lex only felt empty inside. Her tears were silent.
     The pirate ship took them to a different town on the shore where Sadie, Galuron, and Lex were placed in a cell to wait for an envoy from the pirate king that would take them to the capital. For days they say in the cell. Galuron was unable to perform magic because of special iron shackles with strange symbols on the sides. Lex's sadness and anger turned into a rage against Jack. She swore to get revenge.
     One night while they were sleeping, a sound outside the cell startled Lex awake. At the door was Sam holding a ring of keys.
     ”What are you doing?” Lex asked. “It's the middle of the night.”
     ”I'm getting you guys out of here.” Sam whispered.
     ”Why?” Lex asked, startled. “And how can we trust you? You betrayed us before.”
     ”The others may be my friends, be I won't stand by and watch innocent girls be sent to their deaths.” Sam said as he found the right key and unlocked the door.
     ”What about me?” Galuron asked.
     ”You're pretty cool so I'll save you too.” Sam said. “So. Are you coming, princess?” He reached his hand out to her.
     ”I guess so.” Lex replied.
     Sam led them through the dark halls past a few sleeping guards and out into the night. “Wait!” Galuron whispered. “We need to get that book. Alexandra cannot finish her quest without it.”
     ”I thought you might say that.” Sam smiled. “That's why I grabbed it before you.” He opened his coat to reveal the large book underneath.
      The group tiptoed to the stables and quietly guided their horses out of town. Once far enough away, they mounted and galloped as fast as they could.

        <h2 id="ch11">Chapter 11</h2>
        <p>Lex was exhausted by the time they stopped. They retreated far into the woods to keep away from the roads in case the pirates came in search of them. Even though Lex was tired, she needed to see what was contained inside the book that was so important in her quest to defeat the pirates. She opened up the book and tried to read. But she couldn’t! It was written in a language she didn’t know.
Frustrated, angry, and exhausted, Lex threw the book on the ground. “It’s just gibberish!” she yelled.
“That’s what you think,” Galuron said. “This book can only be read in the same location it was written. You must go to the top of what used to be known as the Tower of Prophets, the tallest building in the empire. Only then will its secrets be revealed to you.”
“And what secrets are those?” Sam asked.
“How to use magic,” Galuron told them.
“Why can’t you just teach me?” Lex asked.
“Because even I don’t know the powerful magic contained in this book,” Galuron said. “And according to prophesy, only one of royal blood can use it to its fullest potential.”
“Where is the Tower of the Prophets then?” Lex asked.
“Is it that really tall building in Nork?,” Sam asked Galuron. “I can’t think of any tower that could be taller. The empire now uses it at their headquarters there. They refer to it as the Empire Building.”
“Really creative.” Sadie remarked.
“So we’ll have to sneak to the top of the empire’s building all the way in Nork to read this dumb book that will teach me to use magic powerful enough to defeat the pirate king and take back my kingdom?” Lex asked incredulously.
“Yes,” Galuron affirmed. “It’s the only way.”
“Let’s hurry up then!” Lex said. “We have a long journey to Nork!”
For many days the new group traveled east towards Nork. They only entered towns when necessary and were wary of any one who could be a spy for the pirate king. Sam was very knowledgeable of the land and towns and was able to guide them. He was somber and quiet at first having choosing this new group over his friends, but soon he became more comfortable and friendly with everyone. Sadie was especially pleased with Sam being with them. Sam and Galuron became very good friends on the journey and even Lex, who was suspicious of his intentions at first, became friends with him.
Galuron began teaching Lex the basics of magic. He taught her how matter and energy cannot be created nor destroyed and how anything done with magic draws energy from the person doing the magic. This is why magic is dangerous and only certain people are able to use it at all. Lex learned quickly and soon she could light fires at night with a magic word.
Sam also began teaching Sadie the basics of archery on a cheap bow he bought in a town. Sadie also seemed to learn very quickly and soon was a better shot than even Sam. The group worked very well together. They could defend themselves from pretty much any attack, beast or human, and they pressed farther east.
One night, Lex was practicing magic while on watch while everyone else slept. She was practicing removing the heat from flowers and causing them to freeze. If she did it fast enough, the flowers wouldn’t wilt and would freeze solid still colorful and beautiful. She picked up a flower and held it gently in her hand. She began to think about Jack and his betrayal. Anger swelled through her and without knowing, she crushed the fragile flower in her hand.
A voice startled her from behind. “That was violent.” It was Sam. He came and sat next to her on the log near the fire. “We’re getting near the capital now,” he told her. “Normally I would say that we avoid that place like the plague since that’s where the pirate king is and where your father was killed.”
Lex stiffened in anger. “But,” Sam continued. “I think it’s a perfect opportunity to learn some information. I saw in the last town a poster advertising a masquerade ball being held at the palace. Something about proving that the pirate king isn’t completely evil or something. But all of the highest officials will be there. And no doubt the princess that escaped captivity will be the main topic of discussion. We could go in with disguises and no one would ever think that you were the princess on the run and we might learn if the pirate king has any idea what our plans are.”
“Are you asking me to go with you to a dance?” Lex asked with a giggle.
“I guess I am,” Sam snickered. “A dangerous dance where if we are recognized we’ll be immediately put to death!”
“Sounds fun,” Lex responded.

        <h2 id="ch12">Chapter 12</h2>
        <p>The next morning Sam told Galuron and Sadie his plan. They were skeptical, but agreed that it could be very beneficial. The next day they entered the capital hidden in a wagon driven by some farmers selling their produce in the city. There were soldiers everywhere, and Lex saw that the people all seemed very scared. Once inside, they snuck to a clothing store to get appropriate attire for a formal ball. When it came time to pay for the clothes, Galuron made the copper coins that Sam had look like the gold coins that were needed to buy the expensive clothes. They then checked into a busy inn full of people attending the ball where they stayed the night.
The next day was the big day. The whole city was buzzing with excitement. When the time came, they put on their clothes to go to the dance. When Lex came out of her room, Sam was waiting for her. As soon as he saw her in her sparkling blue dress, he gasped. “You look beautiful,” he told her.
Lex blushed. “Thanks,” she replied.
It was surprisingly easy to sneak into the palace. Lex knew all the secret passageways and the soldiers still didn’t guard them. The ball room was full of people in fancy dress and masks. They decided to split up so that they could hear more conversations. Sam took Lex by the hand and led her through the throngs of people and took her up to a balcony.
“Look for people in uniforms,” Sam told her. “The military officials would know the most.”
Lex scanned the crowd looking for uniforms. Suddenly she gasped. She saw someone with white blonde hair, something she would always recognize. It was Jack.
He was dancing with the same red haired woman who led the pirates at Dawn Lake. Lex clenched her fists and glared down at them.
“Uh oh,” Sam said. “The Wand’ring Wannabes are down there.” Next to Jack were Kaleb and Dal. “We can’t let them see us. They will recognize us even with these masks. We should also warn Sadie and Galuron to stay away from them.”
Lex wasn’t paying attention. She began walking around the balcony towards them.
“What are you doing!?” He asked. “Stay away from them!”
“If we stand on the balcony above them, we may be able to hear what they’re saying,” Lex explained.
They soon reached the spot above them and they could easily hear them.
“…to go east?” Kaleb was saying.
“I don’t know,” Jack responded. “That’s just what The pirate king wants us to do. I guess he’s convinced that the princess is also going east.”
“The pirate king is very powerful,” the red-haired woman said. “He can probably see what she’s doing right now.”
“You’re probably right, Amara,” Jack said.
“I always am,” she said. Jack laughed and they kissed.
Lex flew into a rage. Without thinking she grabbed her shoe and threw it down at them. It hit Jack right in the head and bounced into Amara’s face. Sam pulled Lex away from the ledge.
“What did you do that for!?” Sam whispered urgently as he guided her through the crowd away from Jack and the others. “We have to find Sadie and Galuron and get the heck out of here.”
They ran through the crowd, Lex with one shoe, until they found them. Sam told them what happened and they snuck out the way they came. As they were running, Lex cut her foot on a piece of metal in the street so Sam picked her up and carried her the rest of the way.
When they returned to the inn Lex felt embarrassed and sad. She felt like she ruined the plan in her anger. But Sam seemed actually happy. Lex asked him why he was smiling so much.
“You actually threw your shoe at him,” he chuckled. “And it bounced off him and hit her too!” Sam started laughing.
Lex couldn’t help the smile that came to her face. “You’re right. That was pretty funny,” she said.
“And we even got some info!” Sam said. “Somehow The pirate king knows that we’re heading east to Nork so we have to hurry up and get there before Jack, Dal, and Kaleb do.”
Lex continued to laugh. “That felt really good!” she said.
Sam smiled too. “This is the first time I’ve seen you smile in a long time,” he told her.
“And it’s because of you,” Lex pointed out.

        <h2 id="ch13">Chapter 13</h2>
        <p>The group continued to travel east towards Nork. They grew closer together, especially Sam and Lex. Lex started to be happy again when she was with Sam; he seemed to like her for who she was, not just because she was a princess. Sadie seemed a little disappointed that Sam payed more attention to Lex, but she was still friendly towards both of them.
Finally, many days later, they reached the city of Nork. They could see the Empire Building from far away as it rose hundreds of feet higher than anything around it. Once again, like in the capital, soldiers in patrolled the walls and guarded each gate.
“How are we getting in this time?” Sadie asked.
“Why don’t we fly?” Galuron asked. He was looking up at some gigantic birds circling above them.
“I’ve never seen eagles that big before,” Sam said.
“They only live here in the east,” Galuron explained. He turned to Lex. “I’m going to need your help,” he said. “This word means ‘come.’ When you say it, concentrate on one of the eagles and it should come down to us. If you get enough, we can ride them and I’ll be able to guide them so they take us all the way to the top of the tower.”
Lex did as he asked and brought down four eagles. They looked even bigger up close. They each mounted one and Galuron spoke a word and they rose into the air. At first it was exhilarating, until Lex looked down. Everything looked so tiny and the height made her dizzy. She held onto the bird tighter and closed her eyes.
The birds headed towards the Tower when suddenly arrows started whizzing past. Soldiers on the Tower were shooting at them. Sadie’s bird was hit by an arrow and it started falling. Galuron said another command and the other birds dropped too. Sadie and her eagle hit the ground hard and the other birds landed around them. Both looked seriously injured. They dismounted and ran to Sadie. Lex looked around and saw soldiers coming towards them.
“Go!” Galuron said to Lex. “I’ll stay with Sadie and heal her. I can hide us from the soldiers. You need to get to the top of that tower and read what is written in that book!”
“Come on!” Sam told her. “We don’t have much time.” He grabbed her hand and pulled her towards the bass of the tower.
They ran through side streets and alleys to dodge soldiers working for The pirate king. When they finally reached the tower, there were two guards at the door. Sam and Lex hid behind the corner and heard them talking.
“The archers are having fun shooting birds again,” one said.
The other groaned. “That means we’ll be eating giant eagle for dinner again,” he complained.
“Whew,” Sam sighed. “They didn’t even know we were on the eagles. That means they won’t be looking for us.”
“How are we going to get to the top without them seeing us though?” Lex asked.
“Good question,” Sam pondered.
Suddenly Lex had an idea. She concentrated on the building across the street and spoke the word for fire. Suddenly smoke began billowing out the window. People began yelling and running around. People from the Empire Building began pouring out of the doors as they came out to see what was going on. Sam and Lex snuck through the crowd and into the tower. They began to climb the stairs of the nearly empty building. The stairs seemed to never end. Finally they reached a door and the top and they went through. They were on a balcony at the very top of the tower. There were still a bunch of people up there but they were mostly gathered along the edge watching the fire far below.
They headed to a corner where they would be as inconspicuous as they could and Sam took the book out of his pack. Lexi grew excited as she saw that it had started to glow blue. She grabbed it eagerly and opened it to the first page. Her excitement quickly turned to confusion and then frustration when she discovered that the words inside were still illegible.
Lex grew frustrated and threw the book on the ground. “Why can’t we read it!?” She grumbled.
Sam came close and hugged her. “I don’t know,” he said. “Why don’t you try again? Something is different. They’re glowing!”
Lex opened the book again and flipped through the pages. It was all gibberish and Lex grew angrier. Then on one page, some words glowed brighter than the rest. And Lex could read it! She read it aloud:
“In the day when the empire is ruled by thieves and pirates, a hero shall rise from one of royal blood. She shall study at the library of magic and learn the ancient secrets of magic long lost to the world and lead an army to reclaim what is rightfully hers. She shall be separated from her closest friend as he goes on a mission to bring hope back to the world and tell them of the returning princess. It will be difficult, but she will prevail over her trials and conquer the evil.”
Lex felt a rush of joy. The book really did have secrets and she could read it! She jumped up and hugged Sam. “We did it!” She yelled.
“Shhhh” Sam whispered urgently as some people looked their way.
“We know what to do now!” She whispered back.
In a rush of emotion they embraced each other tightly. After a moment Sam backed away a bit nervously.
“What’s wrong?” Lex asked.
“Nothing!” He replied. “It’s just... You know...” Lex notices that his cheeks were getting a little red. “I’ve come to really enjoy being around you and I really care about you,” Sam blurted out.
“Oh really?” Lex said slyly. “Well, what if I told you I feel the same way about you?”
“Huh?” Sam replied. “I’d probably say something like ‘but I like you more.’”
Lex giggled and looked up into Sam’s blue eyes. He seemed nervous but gazed steadily back into her eyes. Lex’s heart started beating quickly as he slowly leaned toward her. Their lips touched briefly and Sam seemed to gain more confidence. His hand came her cheek and Lex was filled with warmth as they kissed once again. They stood together in bliss for another moment. For a second it felt as if time itself were standing still.
Suddenly Sam looked up and blushed. A couple people were looking at them funny.
“Um...” he coughed nervously. “Can you remember what you read in the book?”
“I don’t think I’ll ever forget this moment.” Lex replied.
“Alright. We better go before more soldiers come back from your fire.” He put the book back in his bag and then grabbed Lex’s hand and headed towards the stairs. As she descended long staircase behind Sam, Lex noticed that she had a silly grin on her face that she just couldn’t seem to get off.

        <h2 id="ch14">Chapter 14</h2>
        <p>After leaving the tower, Lex and Sam reunited with Sadie and Galuron. Galuron had healed Sadie and she was as good as new. Lex told them what she was able to read from the book and Galuron told her where the ancient library of magic was, but that he was confused why the book would send her there when he already learned everything to be learned there. But they travelled north to the library of magic deep in the snowy mountains.
    As they travelled, Sam and Lex grew even closer together. He loved her more than he even knew he had the capacity to love and she loved him even more (or so she said.) They had fun playing little games while traveling in the day and lots of cuddling at night. They were both falling in love.
    They had run ins with Jack, Dal, and Kaleb who threatened to tear Sam and Lex apart and prevent Lex from completing her quest, but Lex, Sam, Sadie, and Galuron prevailed every time.
     However, one day Sam talked to Lex while riding. He said that part of the prophecy had been bothering him. He noticed that Lex was supposed to lead an army to defeat The pirate king, but she would be too busy studying in the north to raise an army. The only option was for Sam to leave and travel to other lands and bring the truth to the people. Both Lex and Sam were sad to be separated, but knew that it was the best thing to do.
    Before Sam left, he pulled Lex into a tight embrace. He then looked her in the eye and said “Lexi, when I'm gone, I want you to focus on learning and progressing. You have enormous potential. You are awesomely smart, stunningly beautiful, and incredibly caring.
