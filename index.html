      <h1>The Legend of Lex</h1>
      <div class="description">
        <p class="home-description"><em>The Legend of Lex</em> is a witty tale of two lovers
        and their battle agains pirates, evil wizards, fierce dragons, and other hidden dangers
        on their quest to save the kingdom and their relationship. Based on a true story,
        each character is inspired by real people, only two of which know this book even exists.</p>
        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p class="home-description">The author met the love of his life when he was a senior in
        high school. Before he could date her, however, he needed to overcome an awkward obstacle:
        she was dating one of his good friends. This book was conceived a few months in to their
        relationship and began as fun bedtime story sent over text. Somehow, the story began to be
        loosely based on their relationship and the exciting story of how they ended up together.</p>
        <p class="home-description">Then one day, the author was called to live in another state
        for two years. As a farewell gift, he quickly drafted the rest of the book in a single
        night and sent it to his sweetheart morning he departed. This is simply of first draft of
        a book that the author and his now wife would someday love to publish to the world. It
        needs some editing, and definitely needs a sequel. So, if anyone feels like reading this
        awkward story and happens to know a lot about writing and publishing, feel free to reach
        out to ashton_hammond@byu.edu and send your ideas!</p>
